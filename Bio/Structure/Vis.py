    Show the structure using a `matplotlib` 3-D plot.
    
    This is a very simply visualisation function, which is best suited for

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig : Figure
        The `Figure` to plot the structures in
    atom_arrays : Iterable object of AtomArray, e.g. AtomArrayStack
        Structures to plot.
    
    Returns
    -------
    ax : Axes
        Axes containing the visualised structures.
