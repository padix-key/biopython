def superimpose(reference, subject, ca_only=True):
    """
    Superimpose structures on a reference structure.
    
    The superimposition is performed using the Kabsch algorithm.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : AtomArray
        The reference structure.
    subject: AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        The structure(s) which is/are superimposed on the `reference`
        structure. Both, `reference` and `subject` should have equal
        annotation arrays and must have equal sizes.
    ca_only: boolean, optional
        If True, the function performs the superimpostion
        considering only the "CA" atoms. This increases the
        performance drastically but decreases the accuracy slightly.
    
    Returns
    -------
    fitted : AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        A copy of the `subject` structure(s),
        superimposed on the reference structure.
    transformation : tuple or tuple list
        The tuple contains the transformations that were applied on `subject`.
        This can be used in `apply_superimposition()` in order to transform
        another AtomArray in the same way.
        The first element contains the translation vector for moving the
        centroid into the origin.
        The second element contains the rotation matrix.
        The third element contains the translation vector for moving the
        structure onto the reference.
        The three transformations are performed sequentially.

    Notes
    -----
    The `transformation` tuple can be used in `apply_superimposition()` in
    order to transform another `AtomArray` in the same way. This can come in
    handy, in case you want to superimpose two structures with different
    amount of atoms. Often the two structures can be sliced in order to
    obtain the same size and annotation arrays. After superimposition the
    transformation can be applied on the original structure using
    `apply_superimposition()`.
